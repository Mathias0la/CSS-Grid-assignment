        Red-eyed tree frog

       <p class="description">The Red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) is a vibrant, nocturnal amphibian native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. Known for its striking red eyes, green body, and blue and yellow striped sides, it uses its bold colors to startle predators. Despite their bright appearance, red-eyed tree frogs are harmless and rely on camouflage to blend into leaves during the day. They are excellent climbers with sticky pads on their toes, which help them grip leaves and branches, and their diet mainly consists of insects.</p>
